Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It involves several key activities:

Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observation.
Analysis: Understanding and refining the requirements to ensure clarity and feasibility.
Specification: Documenting the requirements in a clear, precise, and unambiguous manner.
Validation: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectations of stakeholders.
Management: Tracking and controlling changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
Importance:

Ensures that the final product meets the needs and expectations of users.
Reduces the risk of project failure due to misunderstood or incomplete requirements.
Provides a clear foundation for design, development, and testing activities.
Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is a design principle that divides a software system into distinct, self-contained units or modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. Each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

Benefits:

Maintainability: Easier to update and fix bugs in a specific module without affecting the entire system.
Scalability: Simplifies the process of adding new features or expanding existing ones by adding or modifying individual modules.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of the application or in different projects.
Manageability: Facilitates parallel development by allowing multiple teams to work on different modules simultaneously.
Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing:

Tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
Ensures that each unit performs as expected.
Integration Testing:

Tests the interaction between integrated units or components.
Identifies issues in the interfaces and interaction between modules.
System Testing:

Tests the complete, integrated system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
Covers end-to-end functionality and performance.
Acceptance Testing:

Conducted by the end-users or clients to validate the software against their needs and requirements.
Determines if the software is ready for deployment.
Importance of Testing:

Ensures the software is reliable and functions correctly.
Identifies and fixes defects early in the development process.
Enhances the quality and user satisfaction of the final product.
Reduces the risk of costly post-release issues and maintenance.
Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that manage changes to source code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project. They track modifications, manage different versions, and enable rollback to previous states.

Importance:

Facilitates collaboration among developers by managing code changes and avoiding conflicts.
Provides a history of changes, enabling traceability and accountability.
Supports branching and merging, allowing parallel development of features.
Examples:

Git:

Distributed VCS with branching and merging capabilities.
Popular for its speed, flexibility, and extensive community support.
Platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
Subversion (SVN):

Centralized VCS known for its simplicity and reliability.
Supports atomic commits and versioned directories.
Mercurial:

Distributed VCS with a focus on performance and scalability.
Easy to learn and use, with a strong emphasis on simplicity.
